## Description

__"A brave young man is on a quest to earn the title of Samurai, and he must complete one final challenge: the Skybridge SAMURUN. Only a few have seen the bridge with their own eyes, and even fewer have returned to share their story. The secrets of the bridge remain unknown, but the young man must run, avoid obstacles, and reach the end of the bridge before the sun sets, as the legends say. It seems like a straightforward challenge, but is it really that simple?"__

## Gameplay

SAMURUN is a 3D endless runner game where you must avoid obstacles that randomly appear on the bridge. The goal of the game is to achieve a higher score than your previous attempt by surviving longer on the bridge without hitting an obstacle or falling off. As you progress, the character's speed increases, making it increasingly difficult to avoid a collision.

The game's assets, including the soundtrack, have been designed to evoke Japanese culture, providing an immersive and engaging gaming experience.
