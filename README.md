#### Overview
* SAMURUN is a 3D endless runner video-game. 
* The player controls the character by changing his direction, left or right, and the challenge is about avoiding the obstacles, appearing randomly upon the bridge. 
* The goal of the game is to achieve every time a greater score than the previous one, by surviving longer on the bridge without hitting an obstacle or falling of. 
* The character moves automatically forward and gradually increases his speed, thus it becomes harder to avoid a collision. The greater the speed, the faster the score increases.  
* All the assets of the game, including the soundtrack, embrace a japanese-culture-like concept.

The game controls consists of **left and right arrow keys** on keyboard for PC and **touching on left or right screen area** for smartphones.
