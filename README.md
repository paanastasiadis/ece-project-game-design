# SAMURUN, the video-game
 
## Repository overview

This repo contains the source files of SAMURUN, a video-game developed with Unity 3D by TeamC Studios. This game was designed for the needs of the course "Game Design and Implementation". This course is a part of the undergraduate studies of University of Thessally - ECE Department located in Volos, Greece.

Link to the Department's official site: https://www.e-ce.uth.gr/?lang=en

The main purpose of the course is to provide basic understanding of both game design concepts and Unity Engine fundamentals.
As a result, SAMURUN is the outcome of developing a game from scratch, embracing game design challenges and learning Unity 3D engine. 

## About the game

**_"A brave young man, in a quest to earn the title of Samurai, has to finish one final challenge. The skybridge SAMURUN, a bridge only a few have seen with their own eyes, and fewer returned to share the story. A bridge that no one truly knows its secrets, stands in front of him. He must run, avoid the obstacles and reach the end of the bridge before the sun goes down, as the legends say. A straight forward challenge, a challenge quite simple.Or is it?"_**

* SAMURUN is a 3D endless runner video-game. 
* The player controls the character by changing his direction, left or right, and the challenge is about avoiding the obstacles, appearing randomly upon the bridge. 
* The goal of the game is to achieve every time a greater score than the previous one, by surviving longer on the bridge without hitting an obstacle or falling of. 
* The character moves automatically forward and gradually increases his speed, thus it becomes harder to avoid a collision. The greater the speed, the faster the score increases.  
* All the assets of the game, including the soundtrack, embrace a japanese-culture-like concept.

## About the team

TeamC Studios is not a real game developement studio, just a small collaboration of undergraduate students who enrolled the course "Game Design and Implementation".

TeamC Studios consists of 6 members, responsible for the development of the game:
* Panagiotis Anastasiadis
* George Kaparounakis
* Michalis Zeakis
* George Lalidis
* Christos Katsaros
* Giannis Soumbasis

#### Please consider the following:

 If there are any sights of bad practices or ambiguities regarding the file structure, code quality, the general development of the game or the entire repo management, please mind that this work is an attempt to build a video game for the first time and in the same time learning from the process. Also, consider the lack of expertise or experience that comes along during the time of undergraduate studies. 

**In any case, the project does not represent professional work, rather an avocation with video game developement.**

## How to install

The game was developed with Unity 2019 Editor, thus the same version of the engine is required to be installed on your computer.
* Clone the repo and open the downloaded folder with Unity 2019.
* Select **File->Build Settings->Build and Run->Choose a destination folder of your choice.**
* Go to the destination folder and run the game by double clicking the .exe file.
